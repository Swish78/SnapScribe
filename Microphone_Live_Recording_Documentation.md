# **Real-Time Microphone Recording and Streaming Guide**

This document outlines the process of capturing live audio from the microphone in a web application and streaming it to a backend for real-time transcription.

### **1. Request Microphone Access**
   - The browser needs explicit permission from the user to access the microphone.
   - Use the **MediaDevices API** to trigger a prompt that asks the user to allow microphone access.
   - Once permission is granted, an audio stream from the microphone will be made available for further processing.

   **Note**: Always handle cases where the user denies permission and ensure appropriate feedback is given to the user.

### **2. Capture Audio in Small Chunks**
   - Once the microphone access is granted, the audio data should be captured in small, continuous chunks.
   - These chunks can be managed using the **MediaRecorder API**, which allows the audio to be recorded in a buffer for easy handling.
   - You can define the size and duration of the audio chunks to balance between streaming efficiency and transcription accuracy.

   **Tip**: Keep the audio chunks small (e.g., 2-5 seconds) to reduce latency in real-time applications.

### **3. Stream Audio via WebSockets**
   - For real-time streaming, use **WebSockets** to send the audio chunks to the backend server.
   - WebSockets provide a persistent, bi-directional communication channel that allows the client to stream audio and receive transcription results simultaneously.
   - Ensure that the WebSocket connection is established before starting the recording process and gracefully handle disconnections or network issues.

### **4. Backend Audio Processing**
   - On the backend (e.g., using **FastAPI**), listen to the WebSocket for incoming audio chunks.
   - Pass these chunks through a pre-trained **speech-to-text model** (like Wav2Vec2 or Whisper) to convert the audio into text.
   - Send the transcribed text back to the frontend in real-time, allowing the user to see the live transcription.

   **Note**: If using a cloud-based database, consider processing and storing transcriptions in real-time for users to access later.

### **5. Store Transcriptions in AWS Database**
   - Once the transcription is complete, or periodically during the session, store the audio transcript in **DynamoDB**.
   - This will allow the user to retrieve past meeting transcripts, search within them, and manage their recordings through the app.

   **Tip**: Consider adding metadata (such as speaker identification, timestamps, or keywords) to the database entries to improve the search and retrieval process later.

### **Summary**:
This document provides a high-level overview of how to implement live microphone recording, streaming, and backend transcription. By following these steps, you can build a real-time audio processing system that captures and transcribes spoken content, storing it efficiently for later use.
